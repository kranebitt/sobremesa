# sobremesa (working title)
An app for peer to peer event planning

Sobremesa (upon the table)  is the Spanish tradition of relaxing at the table after a meal. 

This is the working title for a news event planning app. The P2P event planning app that allows individual users to plan events in advance. The app should be available on both iOS and Android platforms.

# Requirements Specification

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a P2P event planning app. The app will allow users to plan events in advance and invite their friends to join them. The app will be available on both iOS and Android platforms.

## Use case(s)
If I wand to find some friends to go hiking with me on Saturday to the Swiss mountain SÃ¤ntis or to go clubbing on Friday or to host a "friendsgiving" table, but don't always want to invite the same friends over Whatsapp, this app provides me with access to my whole contact list plus the surprise factor of matching with people who want to do the same activity withhout having to commit to becoming a close friend or to join yet another whatsapp group. On a central map I see all events taking place around my area and generated by friends/contacts that have me filtered as potential guest. 

Event location operators also see which events take place where and could offer special deals to groups using and tagging the location. For instance cheaper cocktails for the groups at location "Club Nightlife (example" when providing the NFT proof to the bartender(s) or rebate on the Sunday menu on the mountain hut after the hike. 

## Functional Requirements
The app should have the following features:

1. **Event Creation**: Users can create an event by specifying the following details:
    - Event name
    - Date and time
    - Location
    - Duration
    - Equipment
    - Cost contribution
    - Driver

2. **Participant Selection**: The event organizer can select participants based on the following criteria:
    - Contacts from their phonebook (with or without the app)
    - Contacts of contacts
    - Age range
    - Fitness level
    - Gender
    - Relationship status

3. **Sign Up Link**: The organizer can send a sign-up link to participants who do not have the app installed.

4. **Platform Compatibility**: The app should be compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
   
6. **Use of DLT technology**: DLT technology would allow for the app to be perfectly P2P, decentralized and permissionless. Through zk proofs user data could be protected and by minting NFTs access keys could be granted by the event organizer in order to ensure a traceability. It should though not come at the cost of a higher entry barrier or less reliabilty than a classic centralized solution. 

## Non-Functional Requirements
The app should have the following non-functional requirements:

1. **Usability**: The app should be easy to use and navigate.

2. **Performance**: The app should be fast and responsive.

3. **Security**: The app should be secure and protect user data. If DLT is used, no user data should ever be stored onchain.

4. **Scalability**: The app should be able to handle a large number of users and events.

6. **Reliability**: The app should be reliable and available at all times.

## Conclusion
This requirements specification outlines the features and non-functional requirements for a P2P event planning app. The app should be easy to use, fast, secure, scalable, and reliable. It should be available on both iOS and Android platforms.
